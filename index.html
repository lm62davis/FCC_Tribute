      <p>Amelia Earhart was an American aviation pioneer and author. She was the first female
        aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. She set many other records, wrote best-selling books
        about her flying experiences, and was instrumental in the formation of The Ninety-Nines, an
        organization for female pilots.
      </p>
      <p>She presumably lost her life in the Pacific during the circumnavigation, just three weeks prior to her
        fortieth birthday. Nearly one year and six months after she and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared, Earhart was
        officially declared dead. Investigations and significant public interest in their disappearance still continue
        over 80 years
        later.
